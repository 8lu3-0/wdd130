            Hello, I am Jacob Molina, and I am majoring in software engineering. 
            I love playing DnD, going outside, and playing video games. I am also a huge animal lover and want a lot of exotic pets.
            I love coding and finding solutions to problems in code, and I am glad that I took interest in something that will make money.
            In web fundementals I am hoping to learn more about how websites are built and the code behind them.
